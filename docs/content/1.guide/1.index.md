# Introduction

## What is Nimbus?

Nimbus is an alternative way to access your Bluesky account from your browser.

Through the Bluesky API, Nimbus provides similar access to posts and actions on posts you expect to be able to do to Bluesky. You can compose a post, boost others' posts, like, and scroll just as you would through your regular server site.

You can use Nimbus right in your browser. On a mobile device, you can install the app to your home screen as a [Progressive Web App (PWA)](../80.pwa.md).

## What is Bluesky?

Bluesky is an open-source microblogging platform built on the [AT protocol](https://atproto.com/). It aims to provide a familiar microblogging experience while also granting users control over their personal data using [Personal Data Servers (PDS)](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#pds-personal-data-server).

You can think of the service as something similar to Twitter, but with some key differences.

- Where Twitter is a corporation with profit goals and advertisements, Bluesky is an open-source project built on open protocols and maintained by a Public Benefit Corporation.
- Where Twitter users can only interact with other Twitter users, Bluesky users are able to communicate with other ATProtocol-powered platforms.

For more details about Bluesky, see their [website](https://bluesky.social/about), [blog](https://bsky.social/about/blog), [GitHub organization](https://github.com/bluesky-social), [documentation](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/get-started) and the [ATProtocol documentation](https://atproto.com/).

## What is a Bluesky Client?

A Bluesky Client is software that serves up the posts and activities from Bluesky using the [Bluesky API](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/category/http-reference). When you visit or sign in to Bluesky, you use the standard Bluesky client.

A Bluesky client performs similar functions as the standard web interfaces. Using a client, you can:

- View posts from accounts you follow.
- Repost and like posts.
- Create new posts from your own account.
- Follow, unfollow, mute, and block accounts.

All of these apps provide some combination of the features a typical Bluesky user expects for their account.

### Browser-based Bluesky Clients

Nimbus is a Bluesky Client, but instead of being an app to install on your phone, tablet, or desktop, it is an alternative web site you visit in a browser.

In addition to Nimbus, there are other browser-based alternative Bluesky clients. Some include:

- [deck.blue](https://deck.blue/), a multi-column interface for Bluesky.
- [SkyFeed](https://skyfeed.app/), an alternative Bluesky app with a powerful feed builder.
- [Ouranos](https://useouranos.app/), a Bluesky client with a focus on simplicity.
