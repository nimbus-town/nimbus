# Contributing

We're really excited that you're interested in contributing to Nimbus! Before submitting your contribution, please read through the following guide.

## Online

You can use [StackBlitz Codeflow](https://stackblitz.com/codeflow) to fix bugs or implement features. You'll also see a Codeflow button on pull requests (PRs) to review them without a local setup. Once the Nimbus repo has been cloned in Codeflow, the dev server will start automatically and print the URL to open the App. You should receive a prompt in the bottom-right suggesting to open it in the Editor or in another Tab. To learn more, check out the [Codeflow docs](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/what-is-codeflow).

## Local Setup

Clone the repository and run on the root folder:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

`Warning`: you will need `corepack` enabled, check out the [Nimbus Contributing Guide](https://github.com/nimbus-town/nimbus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed guide on how to set up the project locally.

We recommend installing [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni#ni), that will use the right package manager in each of your projects. If `ni` is installed, you can instead run:

```bash
ni
nr dev
```

## Testing

Nimbus uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). You can run the test suite with:

```bash
nr test
```
