## ‚ö†Ô∏è Nimbus is Work In Progress

**Nimbus doesn't work at this point. It's just an idea and playground.**

We welcome PRs if you'd like to help and would like to play too.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Contributing

We're really excited that you're interested in contributing to Nimbus! Before submitting your contribution, please read through the following guide.

### Local Setup

Clone the repository and run on the root folder:

```
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

`Warning`: you will need `corepack` enabled, check out the [Nimbus Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed guide on how to set up the project locally.

We recommend installing [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni#ni), that will use the right package manager in each of your projects. If `ni` is installed, you can instead run:

```
ni
nr dev
```

### Testing

Nimbus uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). You can run the test suite with:

```
nr test
```

## üì≤ PWA

You can consult the [PWA documentation](https://docs.nimbus.town/pwa) to learn more about the PWA capabilities on Nimbus, how to install Nimbus PWA in your desktop or mobile device and some hints about PWA stuff on Nimbus.
